## This is a library for Data Structures in Scala.

### Inside the source file, in the main file, there are the implementations of Mutable and Immutable Data Structures.
### Also inside the source file, but in the test file, there are the tests created to validate those Data Structures.

#### Mutable Data Structures
- Array List
- Linked List
- Double Linked List
- Circular Double Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Graph
- HashMap using buckets
- Array Queue
- Linked Queue
- Array Stack
- Linked Stack
*Some of then were created with the Iterator design pattern*

#### Immutable Data Structures
- Linked List
